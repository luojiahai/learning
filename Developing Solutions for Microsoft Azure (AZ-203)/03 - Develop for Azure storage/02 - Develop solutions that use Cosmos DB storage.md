# Develop solutions that use Cosmos DB storage

## Azure Cosmos DB storage overview

- [**Azure Cosmos DB**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) is a [globally distributed database service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/distribute-data-globally) that's designed to provide low latency, elastic scalability of throughput, well-defined semantics for data consistency, and high availability.

- Core functionality
    - **Global replication** - Azure Cosmos DB has a feature referred to as *turnkey global distribution* that automatically replicates data to other Azure datacenters across the globe without the need to manually write code or build a replication infrastructure.
    - **Consistency levels** - Commercial distributed databses fall into two categories: databases that do not offer well-defined, provable consistency choices at all and databases that offer two extreme programmability choices (strong versus eventual consistency).
